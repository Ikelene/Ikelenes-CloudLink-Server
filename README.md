# CloudLink Python Docker Image
This is the original, Python-based codebase for CloudLink server, As a docker image.

To run:
Clone the git repo and build the docker image yourself.
cd into the directory and run
```
docker build -t ikelene/cloudlink-server:latest .
```
Then in your docker app, the image will appear.
Or it will be available to use in the terminal if you prefer that.

### 🔋Batteries included
The CloudLink Python server comes with full support for the CL4 protocol and the Scratch cloud variable protocol.
Just download, setup, and start!

### 🧱 Plug-and-play modularity
You can easily extend the functionality of the server using classes and decorators. 
Here's an example of a simple plugin that displays "Foobar!" in the console
when a client sends the message `{ "cmd": "foo" }` to the server.

```python
# Import the server
from cloudlink import server

# Import default protocol
from cloudlink.server.protocols import clpv4

# Instantiate the server object
server = server()

# Set logging level
server.logging.basicConfig(
    level=server.logging.DEBUG
)

# Load default CL protocol
clpv4 = clpv4(server)

# Define the functions your plugin executes
class myplugin:
    def __init__(self, server, protocol):
        
        # Example command - client sends { "cmd": "foo" } to the server, this function will execute
        @server.on_command(cmd="foo", schema=protocol.schema)
        async def foobar(client, message):
            print("Foobar!")

# Load the plugin!
myplugin(server, clpv4)

# Start the server!
server.run()
```
